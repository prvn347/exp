## 1. Overview

This document provides internal code documentation for the server application.  The application uses Express.js to create a RESTful API.  It incorporates middleware for JSON body parsing, CORS handling, URL-encoded body parsing and rate limiting.  Routes are dynamically loaded from the `./routes` directory.


## 2. Modules and Dependencies

The application utilizes the following modules and dependencies:

| Module           | Description                                      | Version (Note:  Version information would be added during deployment) |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `express`         | Node.js web application framework                 |                                                 |
| `cors`            | Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)      |                                                 |
| `dotenv`          | Loads environment variables from a `.env` file    |                                                 |
| `express.json()` | Middleware to parse JSON request bodies          |                                                 |
| `express.urlencoded()` | Middleware to parse URL-encoded request bodies |                                                 |
| `limiter`         | Custom rate limiting middleware (defined in `./utils/ratelimit`) |                                                 |
| `initialisedRoutes` | Function to initialize API routes (defined in `./routes`) |                                                 |


## 3. Server Initialization (`startServer` Function)

The `startServer` function initializes and starts the Express.js server.  It performs the following steps:

1. **JSON Body Parsing:** `app.use(express.json())` enables the server to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads.

2. **CORS Handling:** `app.use(cors())` enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing requests from different domains.  This needs proper configuration in a production environment to ensure security.

3. **Rate Limiting:** `app.use(limiter)` applies the rate limiting middleware.  (See section on Rate Limiting below for details).

4. **URL-Encoded Body Parsing:** `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))` enables parsing of URL-encoded request bodies.  The `extended: false` option is used for simpler parsing and security.

5. **Route Initialization:** `initialisedRoutes(app)` loads and registers all API routes defined in the `./routes` directory.  This function likely uses a convention to automatically discover and register route handlers.  Details about the `initialisedRoutes` function would be found in its own documentation.

6. **Server Listening:** `app.listen(PORT, ...)` starts the server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port (`PORT`). The port is determined by the environment variable `process.env.PORT` or defaults to 4000.


## 4. Middleware

The application uses several middleware functions:

* **`express.json()`:** Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.
* **`cors()`:** Enables CORS.  Configuration should be reviewed for production deployment.
* **`limiter`:** Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.
* **`express.urlencoded({ extended: false })`:** Parses URL-encoded request bodies.



## 5. Route Initialization

The `initialisedRoutes(app)` function (located in `./routes`) is responsible for loading and registering all API routes with the Express.js application. The implementation details of this function are not provided here but should be documented separately.


## 6. Error Handling

The provided code snippet does not explicitly include centralized error handling.  Robust error handling should be added to gracefully handle unexpected errors and return appropriate error responses to clients.  This should be a high priority for production deployments.


## 7. Rate Limiting

The `limiter` middleware (from `./utils/ratelimit`) is used to implement rate limiting.  The specific algorithm and configuration details are not provided in this code snippet and should be documented separately within the `./utils/ratelimit` file.  This would include details such as the rate limit window (e.g., per minute, per hour), the maximum number of requests allowed within the window, and how requests are identified (e.g., by IP address).
